## Introduction

The BERN Dapp represents a multipage web application with Ethereum blockchain integration via Metamask. It offers users the ability to create random tasks, all while maintaining the principles of decentralization and security through blockchain technology. The project encompasses a smart contract that governs essential functionalities and securely stores data, along with an Express.js API for authentication purposes. The front-end is built using React (vite@latest), creating an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Create and manage random tasks through the decentralized application.
- Utilize Metamask integration for secure interactions with the Ethereum blockchain.
- Leverage the smart contract to ensure secure and transparent task data management.
- Authenticate users via the Express.js API, enhancing application security.
- Enjoy a seamless and responsive user interface powered by React (vite@latest).

## Technologies Used

The BERN Dapp incorporates a variety of cutting-edge technologies to provide a robust and user-friendly experience:

- Smart Contract: Manages core functionalities and data storage.
- Express.js: Provides a secure API for user authentication.
- React (vite@latest): Delivers an engaging and responsive front-end interface.
- Node.js: Powers the server-side application logic.
- Web3.js: Interacts with the Ethereum blockchain for Metamask integration.
- Ethereum Blockchain: Facilitates decentralized and secure data management.
- Other Dependencies: `nodemon`, `cors`, `web3`, `vite`, and more.

## Installation

To set up and run the BERN Dapp locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Bern-Dapp-3.0`.
3. Install dependencies for both the API and the client by running:
   npm install
4. Make sure you have the necessary tools installed, including `web3`, `nodemon`, `vite`, `express`, and `cors`.

## Usage

1. Start the API server: Navigate to the `api` directory and run:
   nodemon server.js
2. Start the React front-end: Navigate to the `client` directory and run:
   npm run dev3. Access the BERN Dapp in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
