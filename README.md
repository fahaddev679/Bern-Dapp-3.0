# Bern-Dapp-3.0
Here, I have created a full-stack BERN Dapp (Blockchain, Express, React, Node) decentralized application to create some random tasks.
I have created smart contract where all the functionalities are formed and data will be stored and I have created api for some authentications and used react for front end.
I have used react(vite@latest) for front-end, express.js and node.js for api and server,web3.js as library.
To use this code make sure to install depedencies like node modules in both api and client along with web3, nodemon, vite, expess, cors etc.
